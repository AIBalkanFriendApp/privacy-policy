# Privacy Policy for AI Balkan Friend
**Last Updated: February 27, 2026**

At AI Balkan Friend, we value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how your data is handled. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our mobile application.

### 1. Data Controller
For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the developer of AI Balkan Friend acts as the Data Controller. You can contact us at: aibalkanfriend@gmail.com.

### 2. Information We Collect and How We Use It
Because AI Balkan Friend does not require a user account or login, we do not collect personal identifiers like your name, phone number, or physical address. However, to provide the service, we process the following:

Chat Messages: When you send a message to an AI personality, that text is transmitted to our secure backend (Firebase Cloud Functions) and then to the Google Gemini LLM to generate a response.

Usage Data: We may collect basic, anonymous diagnostic data (such as crash reports) through Firebase to improve the app's performance.

### 3. Data Storage and Retention
Local Storage: Your chat history is stored locally on your device using industry-standard encrypted local storage. We do not have access to your local chat history.

Server Processing: Messages sent to our backend are processed ephemerally to generate a response. We do not use your personal chat messages to build user profiles or for advertising.

### 4. Third-Party Service Providers
To function, the app relies on the following trusted third-party providers:

Google Firebase: Used for backend functions and app hosting.

Google Gemini (LLM): Used to process chat text and generate AI responses.
These providers process data according to their own strict privacy and security standards.

### 5. Your Rights Under GDPR
As a resident of the European Union, you have the following rights:

The right to access or delete any data we have processed.

The right to restrict or object to the processing of your data.

The right to data portability.

### 6. Data Deletion Requests
Since this app does not use user accounts, all chat history is stored locally on your device. You can delete this data at any time by clearing the app's cache or uninstalling the app.

If you have sent data to our server for processing and wish to request its deletion from our logs, please email us at aibalkanfriend@gmail.com with your request. We will process your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

### 7. Security
We take the security of your data seriously. All communication between the app and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS to ensure that your messages cannot be intercepted during transit.

### 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

### 9. Contact Us
If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at: aibalkanfriend@gmail.com.
